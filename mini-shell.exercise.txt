mini-shell


Please write a program in C that acts as a mini-shell:

* It reads one line from standard input, parsing it to get the first
  space-separated argument

* It executes the program, searching it in PATH environment variable if
  no path was given.  The rest of the input line should be properly
  passed as arguments to that program.

* It prints the program's output to standard output and errors to
  standard error.

* It reads the next line from standard input, and so on...

* It exits on the special command "exit".


Example shell input: /bin/echo blah
Output: blah


Optional BONUS functionality:

* Implement character '|': multiple commands can be separated
  using the '|' character, which means that the standard output
  of the command to the left is fed to the standard input of the
  command to the right.

Example shell input: echo blah | rev
Output: halb


* Implement character '&': if the ampersand character is used at
  the end of the input line, then the program is executed and
  immediately placed in the background, and mini-shell is ready
  to execute another command.



You are free to use up to the latest C standard (C11) and all
facilities included in the standard C library and POSIX.

You should deliver the code to us regardless of the amount of
completion. Please write a list of follow-up tasks with comments
on the next steps that would have to be taken, in order for you
to be fully confident that the mini-shell is 100% complete and
reliable.

Code portability and clarity are important. Be prepared to
describe your program to us and discuss about potential issues,
future improvements, performance enhancements etc.


Good Luck!
